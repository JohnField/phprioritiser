PHP - based prioritiser
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JohnField/phprioritiser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JohnField/phprioritiser)

## Overview
A modern PHP implementation of a prioritisation grid.
This has been popularised by Richard Bolles' "What Colour Is Your Parachute?" books, though I suspect it's older (not sure of its origin though).

An existing Javascript-based implementation is by [Beverly Kyle](http://www.beverlyryle.com/prioritizing_grid.htm?items=10).

A variant seems to be the [Hoshin Star Technique](http://marketingworks360.com/2015/04/marketing-tips/prioritizing-your-work-the-hoshin-star-technique/); the algorithm appears the same but with a very different visualisation.

## Usage
